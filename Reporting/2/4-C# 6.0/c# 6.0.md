# C# 6.0 Features
### New way for Exception filters, null conditional operator, Expression - Bodied methods
&nbsp;
# Exception Filters-
- C# Exception Filters is a feature of C# programming language. It is introduced in version C# 6.0. It allows us to specify condition along with a catch block.

- C# provides when keyword to apply a condition (or filter) along with catch block.

- A catch block will execute only when the condition is true. If the condition is false, catch block is skipped and compiler search for next catch handler.

&nbsp;

## C# Exception Filter Syntax-

```
 catch (ArgumentException e) when (e.ParamName == "?"){  }
```
## Example of Exception Filter-

```
using System;  
namespace CSharpFeatures  
{  
    class ExceptionFilter  
    {  
        public static void Main(string[] args)  
        {  
            try  
            {  
                int[] a = new int[5];  
                a[10] = 12;  
            }
            catch(Exception e) when(e.GetType().ToString() == "System.IndexOutOfRangeException")  
            {  
                // Executing some other task  
                SomeOtherTask();  
            }  
        }  
        static void SomeOtherTask()  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine("A new task is executing...");  
        }  
    }  
}  
```
## Output-

```
A new task is executing…
```

# Expression-bodied method-
- The main advantage of expression bodies  to reduce the code. 

- Using expression bodies you can create the expression bodies for the function/method, property and reduce the code.

- If you are familiar with lambda expressions then expression bodies are similar to lambda expressions in C#. 

&nbsp;



## Syntax-
```
PropertyType PropertyName => expression;
```

## Example-
Normal code ->
```
 class operatorwork  
    {   
        int length = 5;  
        int width = 10;  
  
        public int area()  
        {  
            return length * width;  
        }  
        public void showarea()  
        {    
            Console.WriteLine("area of reactangle: {0}", area());  
        }   
        
    }  

```
Using Expression-bodied method ->
```
using System;  
namespace operators  
{  
    class operatorwork  
    {  
        int length = 5;  
        int width = 10;  
  
        public int area()=> length * width;  
         
        public void showarea() => Console.WriteLine("area of reactangle: {0}", area());  
    }  
  
    class rectangle  
    {  
        static void Main(string[] args)  
        {  
            operatorwork obj = new operatorwork();  
            obj.showarea();  
            Console.ReadLine();  
            Console.Read();  
        } 
    } 
}  

```
# Null Conditional Operator-
- Null-conditional operators” – a new feature introduced by Microsoft CSharp Team in C# 6.0 will definitely improve the productivity of the developers by reducing lines of code.

- A program usually consists of many code lines just with null checks. Using the null conditional operator, the number of code lines can be reduced and it also becomes a lot easier to read.

- Like nullable types, null-conditional operators can be used now. Just put a ‘?’ (question mark) after the instance before calling the property on top of it. You don’t have to write additional if statements to check for null now.

&nbsp;

## Example 1
```
//old way
public void ShowPerson(Person p)
{
  if (p == null) return;
  string firstName = p.FirstName;
}

//new way
public void ShowPerson(Person p)
{
  string firstName = p?.FirstName;
}

```
Instead of throwing a NullReferenceException with the . operator, ?. returns null. If the left side of the ?. operator returns null, the result of the statement is null. If the left side of the operator is not null, the statement continuous to the right – and in this case accesses the FirstName property and returns the value of this property.

&nbsp;


## Example 2
```
//Condition operator

address = emp != null ? emp.address : null; //old way

address = emp?.address // new way

```

## With the Coalescing Operator (??)
## Example
```
public void ShowPerson(Person p)
{
  string firstName = p?.FirstName ?? string.Empty;
}

```

In case the variable firstName shouldn’t be null but instead should contain an empty string, the null conditional operator works great in combination with the coalescing operator:

&nbsp;

## Conclusion-
Null Conditional Operator improve the productivity of the developers by reducing lines of code. It may also reduce the possible no. of bugs in code keeping the code clean.
