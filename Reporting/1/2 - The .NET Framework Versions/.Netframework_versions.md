# THE .NET FRAMEWORK (Group 2)
**Introduction**
1. The .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows.
2. It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 
3. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). 
4. The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.
   
**What is .NET Framework used for?**
    a. .NET Framework is used to create and run software applications. 
    b. .NET apps can run on many operating systems, using different implementations of .NET. 
    c. .NET Framework is used for running .NET apps on Windows.

**History**
- Microsoft started development on the .NET Framework in the late 1990s originally under the name of Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS). 
- By late 2001 the first beta versions of .NET 1.0 were released.
- The first version of .NET Framework was released on 13 February 2002, bringing managed code to Windows NT 4.0, 98, 2000, ME and XP.
- .NET Framework 2.0. Version 2.0 was released on 22 January 2006. It was also released along with Visual Studio 2005, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, and BizTalk 2006.

## VERSION 2.0
- CLR Version: 2.0
- IDE Released: Visual Studio .Net 2005
- After the success of .Net Framework 1.1, Microsoft released the compact version of the framework and named as .Net Framework 3.0. This version focuses primarily on increasing the developer’s productivity. 
- The version was updated with new features in ADO DotNet like asynchronous database operations, XML data types, user-defined types (UDT), and snapshot isolation. 
- In addition, it includes significant advancements in all areas of ASP DotNet like new data controls, enhanced code-behind model, caching features and many more.

**Features of .Net Framework 2.0:**
- Enhancements to ASP DotNet & ADO DotNet
- Authenticated Stream
- Trace Data Filtering
- I/O enhancement
- Access Control List Support
- Data Protection APIs
- Programmatic control of caching
- EventLog Enhancement
- Console Class addition
- FTP Support
- Generics & Generic Collection
- Serialization
- .NET Framework 4.8 was the final version of .NET Framework, future work going into the rewritten and cross-platform .NET Core platform, which shipped as .NET 5 in November 2020.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## VERSION 3.0
- .NET Framework 3.0, formerly called WinFX, was released on 21 November 2006.
-  There are no major architectural changes included with this release.
- .NET Framework 3.0 uses the same CLR as .NET Framework 2.0.
- It is supported on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Server 2008 R2

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**.NET Framework 3.0 consists of four major new components:**
- **Windows Presentation Foundation** (WPF): A new user interface subsystem and API based on XAML markup language, which uses 3D computer graphics hardware and Direct3D technologies.

- **Windows Communication Foundation** (WCF): A service-oriented messaging system which allows programs to interoperate locally or remotely similar to web services.
  
- **Windows Workflow Foundation** (WF): Allows building task automation and integrated transactions using workflows.
  
- **Windows CardSpace** : A software component which securely stores a person's digital identities and provides a unified interface for choosing the identity for a particular transaction, such as logging into a website.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## VERSION 3.5
- Version 3.5 of the .NET Framework was released on 19 November 2007.
- Version 3.5 uses Common Language Runtime (CLR) 2.0
- There are notable enhancements in WCF, WPF, and WF. In addition, ASP DotNet received Ajax support, and LINQ (Language –Integrated Query) become accessible to ADO DotNet.

**Some core new features and improvements are implemented in .Net 3.0/3.5:**
1. Auto Implemented Property
2. Implicit Typed local variable
3. Implicitly Typed Arrays
4. Anonymous Types
5. Extension Methods (3.5 new feature)
6. Object and Collection Initializers
7. Lambda Expressions

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## VERSION 4.0
- .NET Framework 4 was released on 29 September 2008. 
- The Public Beta was released on 20 May 2009.
- .NET 4.0 - 2010 Dynamic support for languages and TPL (dynamic keyword introduced along with Task Parallel library )

1. Parallel Extensions to improve support for parallel computing, which target multi-core or distributed systems. To this end, technologies like PLINQ (Parallel LINQ), a parallel implementation of the LINQ engine, and Task Parallel Library, which exposes parallel constructs via method calls., are included.
2. New Visual Basic .NET and C# language features, such as implicit line continuations, dynamic dispatch, named parameters, and optional parameters.
Support for Code Contracts.
3. Inclusion of new types to work with arbitrary-precision arithmetic (System.Numerics.BigInteger) and complex numbers (System.Numerics.Complex).
Introduce Common Language Runtime (CLR) 4.0.
4. After the release of the .NET Framework 4, Microsoft released a set of enhancements, named Windows Server AppFabric, for application server capabilities in the form of AppFabric Hosting and in-memory distributed caching support.
