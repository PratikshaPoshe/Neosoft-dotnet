## [Collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/collections/)
- Similar data can often be handled more efficiently when stored and manipulated as a collection. 
- You can use arrays, non-generic or generics.
- Arrays have fixed size and every element must have a value if no value is provided it contains the default.
- Arrays cannot be grown or shrinked. This where collection solves the problem.
- C# offers 2 categories of Collections:
    - non-generics
    - generics
- **Non-generic** collections store items as Object, require casting. Performance concerns were arised due to this casting and also Garbage Collection.
- **Generic collections** are type-safe at compile time. Because of this, generic collections typically offer better performance. 
- Generic collections accept a type parameter when they are constructed and do not require that you cast to and from.
- All collections provide methods for adding, removing, or finding items in the collection.
- All collections can be **enumerated** by virtue of **Enumerator**.
- An enumerator can be thought of as a movable pointer to any element in the collection.
- Types of Collections:
    - Stack - LIFO (Push, Pop, Peek)
    - Queue - FIFO (Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek)
    - List - Like any array which can grow and shrink dynamically.
    - Dictionary<Tkey,TValue> - Key Value Pair
    - LinkedList - Each element points to next.
- You can query your collections using [LINQ](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/linq/linq-tutorials). You can query using query Syntax or Method Syntax.
## [Memory Management in .Net](https://medium.com/c-programming/c-memory-management-part-1-c03741c24e4b)
- The GC allocates heap segments where each segment is a contiguous range of memory.
- Objects are allocated in contiguous blocks of memory.
- To mitigate fragmentation, when the [Garbage COllector](https://medium.com/c-programming/c-memory-management-part-3-garbage-collection-18faf118cbf1) frees memory, it tries to defragment it. This process is called **compaction**.
- Objects placed in the heap are categorized into one of 3 generations: 0, 1, or 2. 
- The generation determines the frequency the GC attempts to release memory on managed objects that are no longer referenced by the app. 
- Lower numbered generations are GC'd more frequently.
- Objects are moved from one generation to another based on their lifetime. 
- As objects live longer, they are moved into a higher generation. 
- As mentioned previously, higher generations are GC'd less often. 
- Short term lived objects always remain in generation 0. 
- For example, objects that are referenced during the life of a web request are short lived. 
- Application level singletons generally migrate to generation 2.

- **What is a finalizer?**
    - Finalizers (which are also called destructors) are used to perform any necessary final clean-up when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector. Some important points about finalizers are:
    - A class can have only one finalizer.
    - A finalizer does not have modifiers or parameters.
    - Finalizers cannot be called explicitly, they are called by the garbage collector (GC) when the GC considers the object eligible for finalization. 
    - They are also called when the program finishes in .NET framework applications.
```
    class Person
    {
        //properties
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }

        public Person() //constructor
        {
            //initialization statements
        }

        ~Person() //finalizer (destructor)
        {
            //cleanup statements
        }
    }
```
- Finalizers called inhertiance chain: finalizers are called recursively for all instances in the inheritance chain, from the most-derived to the least-derived.

```
    class Person
    {
        ~Person() //finalizer (destructor)
        {
            //cleanup statements
            Console.WriteLine("Person's finalizer is called.");
        }
    }

    class Employee : Person
    {
        ~Employee()
        {
            //cleanup statements
            Console.WriteLine("Employee's finalizer is called.");
        }
    }

    class Manager : Employee
    {
        ~Manager()
        {
            //cleanup statements
            Console.WriteLine("Manager's finalizer is called.");
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var manager = new Manager();
        }
    }
```

- **Native memory**
    - Some .NET Core objects rely on native memory. 
    - Native memory can not be collected by the GC. 
    - The .NET object using native memory must free it using native code.
    - .NET provides the IDisposable interface to let developers release native memory. 
    - Even if Dispose is not called, correctly implemented classes call Dispose when the finalizer runs.

- **What is Dispose Method?**
    - We mentioned above that finalizers are called by the garbage collector or when the program finishes (in .NET framework applications). 
    - This means we cannot call them. 
    - If our application uses an expensive external resource, we should then release the resource explicitly. 
    - We can do this by implementing Dispose method from IDisposable interface. 
    - By this way, we can improve the performance of our application as well. Now, letâ€™s see this in practice.

- **How to Implement Dispose Method?**
    - First, we create a class that implements IDisposable interface and then choose Implement interface with Dispose pattern.
```
   class DatabaseConnection : IDisposable
    {

        #region IDisposable Support
        private bool disposedValue = false; // To detect redundant calls

        protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (!disposedValue)
            {
                if (disposing)
                {
                    // TODO: dispose managed state (managed objects).
                }

                // TODO: free unmanaged resources (unmanaged objects) and override a finalizer below.
                // TODO: set large fields to null.

                disposedValue = true;
            }
        }

        // TODO: override a finalizer only if Dispose(bool disposing) above has code to free unmanaged resources.
        // ~DatabaseConnection() {
        //   // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
        //   Dispose(false);
        // }

        // This code added to correctly implement the disposable pattern.
        public void Dispose()
        {
            // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
            Dispose(true);
            // TODO: uncomment the following line if the finalizer is overridden above.
            // GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
        }
        #endregion

    }
```
- Ex:
```
    class DatabaseConnection : IDisposable
    {

        #region IDisposable Support
        private bool disposedValue = false; // To detect redundant calls

        protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (!disposedValue)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("This is the first call to Dispose. Necessary clean-up will be done!");

                if (disposing)
                {
                    // TODO: dispose managed state (managed objects).
                    Console.WriteLine("Explicit call: Dispose is called by the user.");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Implicit call: Dispose is called through finalization.");
                }

                // TODO: free unmanaged resources (unmanaged objects) and override a finalizer below.
                Console.WriteLine("Unmanaged resources are cleaned up here.");

                // TODO: set large fields to null.

                disposedValue = true;
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Dispose is called more than one time. No need to clean up!");
            }
        }

        // TODO: override a finalizer only if Dispose(bool disposing) above has code to free unmanaged resources.
        ~DatabaseConnection()
        {
            // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
            Dispose(false);
        }

        // This code added to correctly implement the disposable pattern.
        public void Dispose()
        {
           // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
            Dispose(true);
            // TODO: uncomment the following line if the finalizer is overridden above.
            GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
        } 
        #endregion

    }
```

- Now, we can use DatabaseConnection class in order to see how Dispose pattern acts in different scenarios.
```
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var connection = new DatabaseConnection();
            try
            {
                //Write your operational code here
            }
            finally
            {
                connection.Dispose();
            }
        }
    }
```

- Another and commonly used method to call Dispose is using using statement:

```
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            using (var connection = new DatabaseConnection())
            {
                //Write your operational code here
            }
        }
    }
```
- As you see there is no call to Dispose method because the using statement handles that automatically.
- Both codes above generate the same output.
- in C# 8.0 and above version you can use [using statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement)
  
  ```
    class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                using var connection = new DatabaseConnection()            
                    //Write your operational code here            
            }
        }
  ```
## [File Handling In C#](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_file_io.htm)
- **System.IO** namespace provides four classes that allow you to manipulate individual files, as well as interact with a machine directory structure.
- The **Directory** and **File** directly extends System.Object and supports the creation, copying, moving and deletion of files using various static methods.
    -  They only contain static methods and are never instantiated.
- The **FileInfo** and **DirectoryInfo** types are derived from the abstract class **FileSystemInfo** type and they are typically, employed for obtaining the full details of a file or directory because their members tend to return strongly typed objects.
    - They implement roughly the same public methods as a Directory and a File but they are stateful and the members of these classes are not static.

## Serialization :
- Serialization is the process of converting an object into a form that can be readily transported. For example, you can serialize an object and transport it over the Internet using HTTP between a client and a server. 
- On the other end, deserialization reconstructs the object from the stream.
- The most common formats of serializations are:
    - [XML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization): XML serialization serializes only the public fields and property values of an object into an XML stream. 
        - You can use [XML Serializer]() class to serialize your objects.
        - The following items can be serialized using the XmlSerializer class:
            - Public read/write properties and fields of public classes.
            - Classes that implement ICollection or IEnumerable.
