## Final Assessment
### Topic - World Trainers
- Finding trainers for inhouse training is always a task for tech companies. Create an app to light this load where:
  - clients and trainers can register themselves,
  - A trainer after registeration and upload its tech skills for better search, update details on experience, education background etc 
  - *(optional) Client upon login can look into some trainer/instructors basic profile (experience and education), filter it based on skills and experience,*
- Login can be a very simple without using any auth framework.
- Finally, deploy this app to Azure App service and share this in into your readMe files and on slack.

### Models
